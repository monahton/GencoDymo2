\title{Identify Single-Exon Genes/Transcripts in GENCODE Data}
\usage{
extract_single_exon(input, level = "gene", output_file = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Either a file path to a GTF/GFF3 file or a data frame representing genomic annotations. The input data should contain at least the columns \code{type}, \code{gene_id}, \code{transcript_id}, and \code{exon_number}. If a file path is provided, it is assumed to be a GTF/GFF file.}

\item{level}{A character string specifying the level of analysis. It should be either \code{"gene"} or \code{"transcript"}. The default is "gene".
The selection allows users to specify whether they want to identify single-exon genes or single-exon transcripts in the annotation.}

\item{output_file}{Optional. A file path to save the results as a tab-separated file. If not provided, the results will not be saved. The file will include the IDs of the single-exon genes or transcripts along with their respective exon IDs. This feature is useful for exporting results for further analysis or reporting purposes.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the IDs of single-exon genes or transcripts based on the selected level.
The returned data frame contains the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{gene_id} or \code{transcript_id}: The IDs of the single-exon genes or transcripts.
\item \code{exon_count}: The count of exons for each entity (always 1 for single-exon entities).
\item \code{exon_id}: The ID of the exon associated with the single-exon gene or transcript.
}

The data frame can then be used for downstream analysis, such as identifying unique single-exon genes or  transcripts, or for exporting to a file.
}
\description{
This function identifies single-exon genes or transcripts from a genomic annotation dataset, typically obtained from the GENCODE database. It processes input data, either from a file or an already loaded data frame, and returns either single-exon genes or single-exon transcripts based on the user's selection. The function works seamlessly with GTF/GFF files or data frames that include the standard GENCODE annotation fields. This is especially useful for identifying genes or transcripts that do not undergo splicing.

\details{
\enumerate{
\item Input Validation: Checks for required columns and valid \code{level} specification.
\item Exon Counting: Groups exons by gene/transcript and counts occurrences.
\item Single-Exon Filtering: Retains only entities with exactly one exon.
\item Output: Returns filtered results; optionally writes to file.
